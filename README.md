## heracles - a realtime text-based online war game

## About

## Design

The site will use AngularJS and Socket.IO to implement a realtime experience.
The client files are served by a static HTTP server, while the core application
logic is implemented by a separate Socket.IO server.

## Development

Start the web and application servers:

```npm start```

Stop the web and application servers:

```npm stop```
